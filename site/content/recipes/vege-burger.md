intro: >-
  There's something about these Aldi burger patties that not only crisps up
  nicely, but creates a really deep and satisfying flavour - almost like
  rissoles! Paired with the tomato chutney, this has a "mature" or "complex"
  flavour (i.e it doesn't taste like t-sauce and your run of the mill meat
  pattie), and if you fry the pattie on a high heat quickly you get a great
  seared bbq flavour as well.
ingredients:

    * Aldi burger rolls (6, $1.79)

      Add some oil to a fry pan and heat until hot. Cook a vege pattie for about
      1.5 minutes each side - flip it when it starts to smell nice and toasted,
      it should crisp up nicely.

      Add 2 teaspoons (about 15g if you're measuring) of the tomato chutney to
      the bun

      Add a handful of salad on top - the chutney will help stick the leaves
      down

  These ingredients will make 4 burgers, each costing $1.90. Annoyingly there'll
  be 2 buns leftover, but these can be frozen and used later.


  Enjoy!
